# LAVI
Toolbox to compute the rhythmicity profile and automatic band detection (both sustained and transient bands) of electrophysiological data, introduced in [Universal rhythmic architecture uncovers two modes of neural dynamics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-73553-8) (Karvat et al 2026).

The Lagged-Angle Vector Index (LAVI) defines the rhythmicity spectrum based on phase persistence, that is, how well the phase (angle) in each frequency and timepoint can predict a future phase. Based on LAVI, the Automated Band-Border detection Algorithm (ABBA) automatically detects band peaks/troughs and borders, with statistical inference on the single-subject level.

## Dependencies
Currently, LAVI and ABBA work on Matlab, with the Curve Fitting Toolbox.  
Although LAVI does not depend on the freely-available toolbox [Fieldtrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/), some functions are inspired by Fieldtrip. Therefore, when using LAVI, please cite also the Fieldtrip toolbox (see reference below).

## Input
The main function, Prepare_LAVI, takes an N_channel x N_timepoints raw electrophysiological data (EEG, MEG, LFP, etc. Examplary EEG data available here as data.mat), and a configuration structure, including the frequencies of interest, sampling rate, lag duration and wavelet width.  
The data should be preprocessed according to conventional standards, for example in EEG, with eye-blinks and 50/60 hz line noise removed. Other artifacts, such as muscle artifacts, can be replaced with NaNs. We tested the algorithm successfully with resting-state data with eyes closed without preprocessing. 

## How to use
Download the functions, and add the folder containing them to your Matlab path.  
The main functions to compute LAVI and ABBA are Prepare_LAVI.m and ABBA.m. Both functions contain help sections explaining their inuputs and outputs.  
For quick implenetation of the main functionalities of LAVI and ABBA, use LAVI_main.m.  
For an annotated, step-by-step, and detailed description of how to use LAVI and ABBA, see the script LAVI_walk_through.m (or live script LAVI_walk_through.mlx)
